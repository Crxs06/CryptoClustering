# CryptoClustering
Cryptocurrency Clustering Project
This project uses K-Means clustering to group cryptocurrencies based on price changes. We find the best number of clusters (k) using the elbow method on both the original scaled data and PCA-reduced data.

We fit K-Means models on both datasets, predict clusters, and visualize the results with interactive scatter plots. PCA helps reduce features while retaining key information, making clustering faster and easier to visualize.

Finally, we compare the clustering results and elbow curves side-by-side to see how fewer features impact the analysis.

The code follows good practices with clear naming, comments, and proper organization. The repository includes all files with meaningful commit messages.
